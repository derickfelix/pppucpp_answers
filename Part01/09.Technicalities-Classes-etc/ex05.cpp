/*
  This exercise and the next few require you to design and implement a Book
  class, such as you can imagine as part of software for a library. Class book
  should have members for the ISBN, title, author, and copyright date. Also
  store data on whether or not the is checked out. Create functions for
  returning those data values. Create functions for checking a book in and out.
  Do simple validation of data entered into a book; for example, accept ISBNs
  only of the form n-n-n-x where n is an integer and x is a digit or a letter.
  Store an ISBN as a string.
