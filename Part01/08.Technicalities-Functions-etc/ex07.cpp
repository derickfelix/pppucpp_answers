/*
  Read five strings into a vector<string> name, then prompt the user for
  the ages of the people named and store the ages into a vector<double> age.
  Then print out the (name[i], age[i]) pairs. The tricky part here is to get
  the age vector in the correct order to match the sorted name vector. Hint:
  Before sorting name, take a copy and use that to make a copy of age in the
  right order after sorting name. Then, do that exercise again but allowing
  an arbitrary number of names.
