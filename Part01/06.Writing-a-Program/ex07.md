##  Programming Principles and Practice using C++ Part 1

### Chapter 06: Writing a program - Ex 07

Write a grammar for bitwise logical expressions. A bitwise logical expression is much like 
an arithmetic expression except that the operators are ! (not), ~ (complement), & (and), 
| (or), and ^ (exclusive or). Each operator does its operation to each bit of its integer 
operands (see ยง25.5). ! and ~ are prefix unary operators. A ^ binds tighter than a | (just
as * binds tighter than +) so that x|y^z means x|(y^z) rather than (x|y)^z. The & operator
binds tighter than ^ so that x^y&z means x^(y&z).
