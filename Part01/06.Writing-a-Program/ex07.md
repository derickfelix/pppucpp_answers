##  Programming Principles and Practice using C++ Part 1

### Chapter 06: Writing a program - Ex 07

Write a grammar for bitwise logical expressions. A bitwise logical expression is much like 
an arithmetic expression except that the operators are ! (not), ~ (complement), & (and), 
| (or), and ^ (exclusive or). Each operator does its operation to each bit of its integer 
operands (see ยง25.5). ! and ~ are prefix unary operators. A ^ binds tighter than a | (just
as * binds tighter than +) so that x|y^z means x|(y^z) rather than (x|y)^z. The & operator
binds tighter than ^ so that x^y&z means x^(y&z).

**Binary-Inclusive-OR:**<br/>
    Binary-Exclusive-OR<br/>
    Binary-Inclusive-OR "|" Binary-Exclusive-OR // Inclusive<br/>

**Binary-Exclusive-OR:**<br/>
    Binary-AND<br/>
    Binary-Exclusive-OR "^" Binary-AND  // Exclusive<br/>

**Binary-AND:**<br/>
    Unary</br>
    Binary-AND "&" Unary    // And<br/>

**Unary:**<br/>
    Primary<br/>
    Unary "!" Primary   // Not<br/>
    Unary "~" Primary   // Complement<br/>

**Primary:**<br/>
    Number<br/>
    "(" Binary-Inclusive-OR ")" // Grouping<br/>

**Number:**<br/>
    Integer<br/>
