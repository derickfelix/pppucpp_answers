/*
    Most class hierarchies have nothing to do with graphics. Define a class 
    Iterator with a pure virtual function next() that returns a double* (see
    Chapter 17). Now derive Vector_iterator and List_iterator from Iterator
    so that next() for Vector_iterator yields a pointer to the next element
    of a vector<double> and List_iterator does the same for a list<double>.
    You initialize a Vector_iterator with a vector<double> and the first call
    of next() yields a pointer to its first element, if any. If there is no
    next element, return 0. Test this by using a function void print(Iterator&)
    to print the elements of a vector<double> and list<double>.
