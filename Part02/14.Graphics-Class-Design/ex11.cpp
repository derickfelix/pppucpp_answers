/*
    Define a Binary_tree class derived from Shape. Give the number of level
    as a parameter (levels==0 means no nodes, levels==1 means one node,
    levels==2 means one top node with two sub-nodes, levels==3 means one
    top node with two sub-nodes each with two sub-nodes, etc.). Let a node
    be represented by a small circle. Connect the nodes by line (as is 
    conventional). P.S. In computer science, trees grow downward from a top
    node (amusingly, but logically, often called the root).
